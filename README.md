### Hi there 👋

My name is Dhruv, an amateure fullstack developer and ECE student at the University of Waterloo. I like playing around with new technologies and making fun projects that solve some of the most ambitious solutions that wander in my head. 


#### 🔭    I’m currently working on two different projects:
- Mediconnect 👨‍⚕️ is a MEAN stack web application that promotes organization and efficiency when connecting physicians with their patients. My goal for this project is to work on UI design and working with more complex state and API. 
- ML DOOM is a Python project that scrapes lyrics from the 🐐 MF DOOM, feeds it into a Tensorflow model, then outputs similar lyrics onto a Flask web application. 

#### 🌱    I’m currently learning
- Angular
- Machine learning
- Working with containers through Docker
- Other web development frameworks and libraries
