#### 🔭    I’m currently working on two different projects:
- Mediconnect 👨‍⚕️ is full-stack web application that promotes organization and efficiency when connecting physicians with their patients. My goal for this project is to work on UI design, complex state, and a more sophisticated API. Tools used include Angular, ASP .NET Core, and a SQL server
- ML DOOM is a Python project that scrapes lyrics from MF DOOM, feeds it into a Tensorflow model, then outputs similar lyrics onto a Flask web application.

#### 🌱    I’m currently learning
- Angular
- Machine learning
- Other web development frameworks and libraries such as ASP .NET
